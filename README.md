# Clinical_trials_gov
This project looks at the clinical trials data available at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/resources/download. 
The most common variables are cleaned and free text fields are parsed and mined for common words. 
The resulting data is used in some of the most popular machine learning algorithms to predict how many days a completed study lasted (days_to_completion) and to classify if a study was completed or ended/terminated.
This project is ongoing and is primarily a way for me to play around with and learn python.
